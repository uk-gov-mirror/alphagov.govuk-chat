      <p>When renewing your driving licence, you do not need to send your old licence back to DVLA in most cases.</p>
      <p>However, there are some specific situations where you must send your old licence to DVLA:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>if you find your old licence after applying for or receiving a replacement for a lost, stolen, damaged or destroyed licence</li>
        <li>if DVLA writes to you asking for your licence (for example, if you're a new driver with 6 or more penalty points, have been disqualified, or have changed your address)</li>
        <li>after getting a new lorry or bus licence, if you have not already sent your old licence</li>
      </ul>
      <p>For standard licence renewals, you can keep your current licence while applying and do not need to return it unless specifically asked by DVLA.</p>
      <p>Check the <a href='https://www.gov.uk/renew-driving-licence#apply-at-a-post-office'>guidance on renewing your driving licence</a> for more information about the renewal process.</p>
